# Jumpy platformer-
My game is a jump-based platformer and I got some inspiration from many templates that I found on the internet. I modified the script by adding some variables which made the character not able to jump midair. Now, the character can only jump once off the ground. The other modification I made was I added a ground check near the middle/end of all the code, so the sprite can stay grounded after it jumps. How to play the game is: press the A key or left arrow key to move left, and press the D key or rigth arrow key to move right. To jump, you must press the space key. There will be obstacles in the game, such as little red blobs which can kill you unless you evade them or jump on them. There are also coins which you can interact with for certain benefits. Challenges I faced were putting the assets in the right layers, but I searched up how to do this and I figured out how it's done. I also struggled a bit deciding which assets I should put in my scene, but eventually I decided to keep some special steps where the character would jump onto. I am most proud of the look of my sprite because I think it is fairly detailed.
